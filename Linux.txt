---------------------------CHAPTER 14 Network Configuration-----------------
Key terms 
	Host is a device that communicates via a network with another device.
	Network is a collection of two or more hosts that are able to communicate with each other. 
	Internet  consists of a publicly accessible network that connects millions of hosts.
	Wi-FI Wireless networks.
	Server A host that provides services to another host.
	Service feature provided by a host.
	Client a host that is accessing a server.
	Router also called a gateway isa machine that connects hosts from one netwrok to another.
	
	Packet is used to send network communication between hosts. By breaking down communication into smaller chunks.
	IP Address is a unique number assigned to a host on a network.
	Mask (subnet mask) is a number system that can be used to define which IP addresses are considreed to be within a single network.
	Hostname names are more natural for humans to remember than numbers. Hostnames are translated into iP addresses.
	URL is used to locate a resource on the internet.
	DHCP defines how network information is assigned to client hosts.
	DNS provides the service of translating domain names into IP addresses.
	Ehternet cables are connetced to a network cards that supports ethernet connections. This cablesa re desgined to support different speds from 10Mbps to 100Gbps.
	TCP/IP Is a collection of protcols that are used to define how a network communication should take place between hosts.
	
	
IP Address

IPv4 addresses a total of ofur 8 bit numbers are used to define the address. This is considered a 32-bit address using decimal
192.168.10.120

IPv6 addresses are much larger using a 128-bit addresess using hexadecimal
2001:0db8:85a3:0042:1000:8a2e:0370:7334

 Two reason why the change from IPv4 to IPv6 has been done 
	NAT: A group of hosts shares a single IP address 
	Porting: is switching over from one technology o another 


Configuring IPv4

In CentOS the primary IP config file is the /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
When a device is going to be configures by DHCP the BOOTPROTO value would be DHCP and the IPADDR, GATEWAY nad DNS1 values wold not be set.

Configuring IPv6
In CentOS the primary IP config file is the /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
To use IPv6 you should add the following lines 
	IPV6INIT=yes	
	IPV6ADDR=<IPv6 IP Address>
	IPV6_DEFAULTGW=<IPv6 IP Gateway Address>

You also need to add the following setting to the /etc/sysconfig/network file
	NETWORKING_IPV6=yes
	

Domain Name System (DNS)

The address of the DNS is stored in the /etc/resolv.conf file 


Network Configuration Files 

/etc/hosts contains the hostnames to IP addresess 
/etc/resolv.conf contains the IP addresess of the name servers 
/etc/nsswitch.conf can be used to modify where hostnames look ups occurs. contains a filed which describes in what orderto look up 

Network Tools 
Useful tools to troubleshoot network issues 

ifconfig displays network configuration but it is being replace with ip addr show 
inet addr: <ip address> 
eth0 is th network device

The ip command branches out to do some of the work of several legacy commands such as route and arp 

route command is used to view a table that desribes where network packages are sent. It is bein replacedd with the ip route command

ping command ca be used to determine if another macine is reachable 
ping will send packets endlessly but with the option -c yo can determine how many pings to send 

netstat command displays a large amount of network info about network connections and the roting table. It is being replaces with ss, netstat -r with ip route and netstat -l is ip-s link
Important outputs to check are the TX-OK and TX-ERR. A high % of TX-ERR may indicate a problem on the network
Also commonly to display open ports.

ss command shows socket statsitcis and supports all major packet and socket types 
netid Socket type and transport protocol 
state connected or unconnected 
recv-Q amount of data queued up for being processed having been received 
send-Q amount of data queued up or being sent to another host 
Local address address and port of the local hosts's portion 
Peer address address and port of the remote host's portion 

dig command perform qeris on the NDS server to determine if the info is avvailble

host command associates hostname with IP address using the DNS 

ssh command allows you to connect to another machine across the network


------------------------------CHAPTER 15 System and User Security--------------------------------

Creating user allows to give each one permissions which are file and directory permissions given by the system to the users, groups and everyone.
each user belongs to at least one group to allow user users to more easily share data 

Administrative Accounts 
logging in as the root user allows you to execute commands as the admin.
It is not recommended to log in as the root directly becuase you can run a commmand that may disrupt the server 

use the sudo command to execute command without being the root 
su command to switch between users 

Switching Users 
su command to switch users 
	su [options] [username]
	
when switching user it is recommended to use login shell as it fully configures the new shell with hte setting of the new user.
	su-
	su -large
	su --login
	

Executing Privileged Commands 

sudo commands allows user to execute commands as another user 

User Accounts

The /etc/passwd file defines some of the account info for user accounts 

sysadmin:x:1001:1001:System Administrator,,,,:/home/sysadmin:/bin/bash
name:password:user ID: Group ID: Comment: home directory: shell

The password field is detailed in the /etc/shadow file 


Passwords 
This are saved in the /etc/shadow file 

sysadmin:$6$c75ekQWF$.GpiZpFnIXLzkALjDpZXmjxZcIll14OvL2mFSIfnc1aU2cQ/221QL5AX5RjKXpXPJRQ0uVN35TY3/..c7v0.n0:16874:5:30:7:60:15050::
username:encypted password: last cahnge: minimum: maximum: warn: inactive: expire: reserved 

	Last change: represents the last time the password was changed the number is in epoch time 
	minimum: indicates the minimum numbers of days between password changes, a minimum field of 0 means the user can change the password anytime 
	maximum: indicates the numbers of days the password is valid, this force the user to change the password in a regular basis 
	warn: indicates the numbers of days before the max numbers of days have passsed. A prompt will appear before the max days have been reached.
	inactive: When the user ignores the warn their account will go inactive and will have a "grace" period of tie to change the passsword 
	Expire: represetns the number of days the account will expire 
	
	
	
SYSTEM ACCOUNTS
Regular user accounts typically have an UID values greater than 500 on some sytems 1000
Root user has special acces to the system with an UID 0 

System acounts are assigned with a UID value of 1 to 499 and are designed to provide accounts for services that are running on the system 
Sytem accounts generraly doesnt have a home directory 


GROUP ACCOUNTS
Each user can be a member of one or more groups which can lso affect the level of access to the system 
Primary group of a user can be found in /etc/passwd file 
Secondary groups and groups themselves can be found in /etc/groups file  

mail:x:12:mail,postfix
group name: passsword: GID: user list 


VIWEING USER INFORMATION 
id command is usd to print user and group info for a specified user 
uid=1001(sysadmin) gid=1001(sysadmin) groups=1001(sysadmin),4(adm),27(sudo)
the command lists the user ID and username first, primary group with its GID, and finally secondary group


VIEWING CURRENT USERS 
who command displays a list of users logged in where they are logged in from and when.

sysadmin	   pts/0	2013-10-11 09:59 (:0.0)
username       terminal date             host

Viewing Login History 
last command reads the entire login history from the /var/log/wtmp file and displays all logins and reboots



----------------------CHAPTER 16 Creating Users and Groups-----------------------

On some distro creating a new user account also automatically creates a group account for the user called User Private Group (UPG)
For the distros that does not do that then new users are typically given the users group as their primary group.

Users can be created with memberships in groups that already exists, or existing users can be modified to have memberships in existing groups
It is more efficient to create the groups first then users 


GROUPS 
Most common reason to create groups is to provide a way for users to share files.
You can verfy the changes by viewing the /etc/group file with a grep command 

CREATING A GROUP
groupadd command by the root user to create a new group. You only need the name of the group to be created. With -g option can be use to specify a GID 
groupadd -g 1006 test

GROUP ID CONSIDERATIONS 
You should avoid creating GID in the same numeric range where you expect to create UIDs 

GIDs under 500 (redHat) or 1000 (debian) are reerved for system use. 
to assign a lower GID value you can use the -r option 

GROUP NAMING CONSIDERATIONS 
	First character of the aname should be either and underscore or a lowercase
	Up to 32 characters but the recommendation is to use less than 16
	The last character should not be a hyphen (-) 
	
	
MODIFYING A GROUP
groupmod command can be used to either change the nae of a group with the -n option or change the GID with the -g option.
Changing the gorup's name will not disrupt the access to the files but changing the GID will cause problems.

If you change the GID for a group then all the files with that group will not longer be associated with that group.

use the command find -nogroup to search for all the orphaned files.


DELETING A GROUP
groupdel commmand will delete a group. Only secondary groups can be deleted.
AS long as a group is not a primary group for any user it can be deleted.


USERS
user info is stored in /etc/passwd and authentication info is stored in /etc/shadow 

Group shows the primary group f the user by default is the 100 use the -g option to specify a different primary group 

Home shows the /home directory of the new user for example if the new user is bob its home directory would be /home/bob 
to change its home directory use the -b opion 

Inactive value represetns the number of days after the passwd expires that he account is disable.
A value of -1 means it is not enable.
Use the -f option to use a different value 

Expire there s no value in this field. usually an expiration date is set on an individual account 
-e option to modify 

Shell indicates the default shell for a user when they log in.
Use the -s option o use a different login shell.

Skeleton Direcory 
Skel value determines which skeleton directory has its contents copied into the new user's home directory
-k option to use a different SKEL 

Create mail spool is a file where incoming emails is placed
